# NootNootChatbot

Welcome to our official Nootnoot Weather API Chatbot.

## Introduction
Nootnoot is a chatbot application that uses weather API from the [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org) website to provide users with real-time information on the weather of their desired cities.

# Functionality
Nootnoot understands user input and responds accurately using natural language processing. Its features include:

- Real-time weather updates
- Weather forecast for the next 5 days
- Welcoming the user
- Inputting city name
- Searching weather data
- Extracting temperature data
- Providing more explanation of the climate
- Suggesting the type of clothing
- Audio functionality

## Visuals
The following video gives you an overview of how the chatbot works and answers.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Technologies Used
NootNoot is built on a number of technologies such as:
- Java programming language (Eclipse Java (Version 2021-09 (4.21.0)) and IntelliJ IDEA (Version 2021.2.1))
- OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data
- GitLab is used as a repository to store this code
- FreeTTS for audio functionality (Kevin16)
